                <p align="justify">For more than 60 years, Pizza Hut has been slinging hot, cheesy pies to hungry consumers all over the world.Actually, there are many people who believe that Pizza Hut is a more “authentic” choice which is similar to Italian dishes. 
                The pizza's texture is soft and delicious. Furthermore, the delivery speed and the quality of Pizza Hut ingredients are far better than Domino's.Pan pizza is a pizza baked in a deep dish pan or sheet pan. 
                Italian tomato pie, Sicilian pizza, Chicago-style pizza and Detroit-style pizza may be considered forms of pan pizza.Pizza Hut knocked it out of the park when it came to the toppings. There was plenty of pepperoni scattered on top with a really great crispy texture. And the cheese was pretty exceptional, too. 
                It was creamy and melty—giving us all those ooey-gooey moments we love.<br>
                Pepperoni. Poll after poll, pepperoni always tops the list of America's favorite pizza toppings. When it doubt, you can't go wrong with a classic.

                <h1 align="center">HISTORY OF PIZZA</h1>
                <p align="justify">The history of pizza begins in antiquity, when various ancient cultures produced basic flatbreads with several toppings.
                    A precursor of pizza was probably the focaccia, a flatbread known to the Romans as panis focacius, to which toppings were then added.Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century.
                    The word pizza was first documented in 997 AD in Gaeta and successively in different parts of Central and Southern Italy. Pizza was mainly eaten in Italy and by emigrants from there. This changed after World War II when Allied troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods.

                <img src="./i3/i11.jpg" alt="pizza" align="right" class="img">
                <p align="justify">Canada's first pizzeria opened in 1948, Pizzeria Napoletana in Montreal. Starting in the late 1950s, the first pizza ovens started entering the country. It gained popularity throughout the 1960s, with many pizzerias and restaurants opening across the country. Pizza was mostly served in restaurants and small pizzerias. 
                    Most pizza restaurants across Canada also serve popular Italian cuisine in addition to pizza, such as pasta, salad, soups and sandwiches. Fast-food pizza chains also provide other side options for customers to choose from, in addition to ordering pizza, including chicken wings, fries and poutine, salad, and calzones. Pizza Pops are a Canadian calzone-type snack introduced in the 1960s. 
                    Pizza chains across Canada can be found in shopping centres, schools, and neighbourhood plazas, with the majority of these chains offering a sit-and-dine facility for customers.
                    The most distinct pizza in Canada is the "Canadian" pizza. A "Canadian" pizza is usually prepared with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, and bacon. Many variations of this pizza exist, but the two standout ingredients that make this pizza distinctly Canadian are bacon and mushrooms. Pizzas in Canada are almost never served with "Canadian bacon", or back bacon as it's referred to in Canada. Rather, side bacon is the standard pork topping on pizza.
                    In the province of Quebec Pizza-ghetti is a combination meal commonly found in fast food or family restaurants. It consists of a pizza, sliced in half, accompanied by a small portion of spaghetti with a tomato based sauce. Although both pizza and spaghetti are considered staples of Italian cuisine, combining them in one dish is completely unknown in Italy. A popular variant involves using spaghetti as a pizza topping, under the pizza's mozzarella chees
                    Some of Canada's successful pizza brands include: Boston Pizza, Pizza Pizza, and Vanelli's. Boston Pizza, also known as BP's in Canada, and "Boston's – the Gourmet Pizza" in the United States and Mexico, is one of Canada's largest franchising restaurants.The brand has opened over 325 locations across Canada and 50 locations in Mexico and the US.The first Boston Pizza location was opened in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1964, and operated under the name 
                    "Boston Pizza & Spaghetti House", with locations still opening across the nation. 
                    Pizza Pizza, and its subsidiary chain Pizza 73 in Western Canada, are among Canada's largest domestic brands based in Ontario.[citation needed] To date, they have over 500 locations nationwide, and fill more than 29 million orders annually.
                    Vanelli's is an international pizza chain that is based in Mississauga. The chain first opened in 1981, serving both pizza and other fresh Italian cuisine, such as pasta and Italian sandwiches.In 1995, the brand opened its first international location in Bahrain and became an international success. The brand continued to open additional locations across the Middle East, with chains now opened in the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, and Morocco.
                    There are over 110 locations worldwide; making Vanelli's the first pizza brand in Canada to open locations internationally.
                    With pizza gaining popularity across the nation, major American pizza chains such as Pizza Hut, Domino's Pizza and Little Caesars have expanded their locations in Canada, competing against the domestic Canadian brands. The major American pizza chains have brought their signature classic pizza recipes and toppings into their Canadian chains, offering their traditional classic pizzas to Canadian customers. However, the American chains have also created Canadian specialty pizzas that are available only in Canada.</p>

                <img src="./i3/i12.jpg" alt="pizza" align="left" class="img" >
                <p align="justify">Pizza first made its appearance in the United States with the arrival of Italian immigrants in the late 19th century and was popular among large Italian populations in New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, Trenton and St. Louis.[citation needed]
                    According to a 2009 response published in a column on Serious Eats, the first printed reference to "pizza" served in the US is a 1904 article in The Boston Journal.[42] Giovanni and Gennaro Bruno came to America from Naples, Italy, in 1903 and introduced the Neapolitan pizza to Boston. Later, Vincent Bruno (Giovanni's son) went on to open the first pizzeria in Chicago.
                    Conflicting stories have the first pizzeria opening in 1905 when Gennaro Lombardi applied for a license in New York to make and sell pizza. One of the generally accepted first US businesses to sell pizza, Lombardi's, opened in 1897 as a grocery store at 53½ Spring Street, with tomato pies wrapped in paper and tied with a string sold at lunchtime to workers from the area's factories. 
                    In 1905, putative founder Gennaro Lombardi received a business license to operate a pizzeria restaurant, and soon had a clientele that included Italian tenor Enrico Caruso. He later passed the business on to his son, George.
                    Pizza was brought to the Trenton area of New Jersey with Joe's Tomato Pies opening in 1910, followed soon by Papa's Tomato Pies in 1912. In 1936, De Lorenzo's Tomato Pies was opened. While Joe's Tomato Pies has closed, both Papa's and Delorenzo's have been run by the same families since their openings and remain among the most popular pizzas in the area. Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana in
                     New Haven, Connecticut, was another early pizzeria which opened in 1925 (after the owner served pies from local carts and bakeries for 20–25 years) and is famous for its New Haven–style Clam Pie. Frank Pepe's nephew Sal Consiglio opened a competing store, Sally's Apizza, on the other end of the block, in 1938. Both establishments are still run by descendants of the original family. 
                     When Sal died, over 2,000 people attended his wake, and 
                     The New York Times ran a half-page memoriam. The D'Amore family introduced pizza to Los Angeles in 1939.
                    Before the 1940s, pizza consumption was limited mostly to Italian immigrants and their descendants. Following World War II, veterans returning from the Italian Campaign, who were introduced to Italy's native cuisine proved a ready market for pizza in particular, touted by "veterans ranging from the lowliest private to Dwight D. Eisenhower". By the 1960s, it was popular enough to be featured in an episode of Popeye the Sailor.
                    Pizza consumption has exploded in the U.S with the introduction of pizza chains such as Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's.[failed verification]
                    Two entrepreneurs, Ike Sewell and Ric Riccardo, invented Chicago-style deep-dish pizza, in 1943. They opened their own restaurant on the corner of Wabash and Ohio, Pizzeria Uno.
                    Pizza chains sprang up with pizza's popularity rising. Leading early pizza chains were Shakey's Pizza, founded in 1954 in Sacramento, California; Pizza Hut, founded in 1958 in Wichita, Kansas; and Little Caesars, founded in 1959 in Garden City, Michigan.[citation needed] Later restaurant chains in the dine-in pizza market were Bertucci's, Happy Joe's, Monical's Pizza, California Pizza Kitchen, Godfather's Pizza, and Round Table Pizza, as well as Domino's, Pizza Hut, Little Caesars and Papa John's. 
                    Pizzas from take and bake pizzerias, and chilled or frozen pizzas from supermarkets make pizza readily available nationwide.</p>
